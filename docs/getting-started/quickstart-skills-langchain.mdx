title: 'Quickstart: Copilot Skills (LangChain & LangGraph)'
description: 'How to integrate standalone LangChains and LangGraphs'
---


## Background

With a single line of code, you can bring specialized LLM Chains and Graphs into your in-app AI Copilot.

CopilotKit wraps your app, and routes relevant state as input to standalone skill chains (state can come from the frontend, backend, 3rd party integrations, or from the user).

When the chain returns, the Copilot Engine funnels its output to in-app interaction as needed.

## Server Side Actions

CopilotKit supports actions that can be executed on the server side. You can define server side actions by passing the `actions` parameter:

```typescript
const copilotKit = new CopilotBackend({
  actions: [
    {
      name: "sayHello",
      description: "Says hello to someone.",
      argumentAnnotations: [
        {
          name: "arg",
          type: "string",
          description: "The name of the person to say hello to.",
          required: true,
        },
      ],
      implementation: async (arg) => {
        console.log("Hello from the server", arg, "!");
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Server side actions can also return a result which becomes part of the message history.

This is useful because it gives the LLM context about what happened on the server side. In addition,
it can be used to look up information from a vector or relational database and other sources.

In addition to that, server side actions can also come from LangChain, including support for streaming responses.

Returned results can be of the following type:
- anything serializable to JSON
- `string`
- LangChain types:
  - `IterableReadableStream`
  - `BaseMessageChunk`
  - `AIMessage`

## LangServe

The backend also supports LangServe, enabling you to connect to existing chains, for example python based chains.
Use the `langserve` parameter to specify URLs for LangServe.

```typescript
const copilotKit = new CopilotBackend({
  langserve: [
    {
      chainUrl: "http://my-langserve.chain",
      name: "performResearch",
      description: "Performs research on a given topic.",
    }
  ],
});
```
