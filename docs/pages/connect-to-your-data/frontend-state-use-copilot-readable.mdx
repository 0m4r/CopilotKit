# Connect the Copilot to your data

For your copilot to best answer your customers' needs, you will want to provide it with **context-specific**, **user-specific**, and oftentimes **realtime** data.
CopilotKit makes it easy to do so.


## Frontend state: `useCopilotReadable`

Generally speaking, the state of your application most relevant for the Copilot at any given moment, is **the state the user is currently viewing and interacting with.**
Naturally, this is precisely the state available to the frontend application.

Each react component should expose to the Copilot the data that it deems relevant to the Copilot's operation.
When the component loads/unloads, the data will **automatically** be included/excluded from future Copilot interactions.

<Steps>
### Add 'use client' directive if necessary

Similar to other React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, `useCopilotReadable` is a **client-side hook**. If your component is part of a Next.js app using the App Router, you'll need to add the 'use client' directive at the top of your file:

```tsx filename="YourComponent.tsx"
"use client";
```

### Import and use the hook


```tsx filename="YourComponent.tsx" showLineNumbers {1,7-10}
import { useCopilotReadable } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

export function YourComponent() {
  const { colleagues } = useColleagues();

  // Define Copilot readable state
  useCopilotReadable({
    description: "This user's colleagues",
    value: users,
  });

  return (
    // Your custom UI component
    <>...</>
  );
}
```
</Steps>


### Advanced use: data tree hierarchy
Sometimes you may want to tie a component's Copilot data to its parent component, to create a data tree hierarchy.
