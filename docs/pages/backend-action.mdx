# Let the Copilot Take Action

<Steps>

### `useCopilotAction`

In addition to understanding state, you can empower the copilot to take actions. Use the `useCopilotAction` hook to define specific tasks that the copilot can perform based on user input.

```tsx filename="YourComponent.tsx" showLineNumbers {7-20}
import { useCopilotReadable, useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

export function YourComponent() {
  const { employees, selectEmployee } = useEmployees();

  // Define Copilot action
  useCopilotAction({
    name: "Select an employee",
    description: "Select an employee from the list",
    parameters: [
      {
        name: "employeeId",
        type: "string",
        description: "The ID of the employee to select",
        required: true,
      }
    ],
    handler: async ({ employeeId }) => {
      selectEmployee(employeeId);
    },
  });

  return (
    // Your custom UI component
    <>...</>
  );
}
```

### `"use client"` (Next.js App Router)
```tsx filename="YourComponent.tsx" showLineNumbers {1}
"use client"  # (only necessary if you are using Next.js App Router)
```

Like other React hooks, this hook needs to be run on the client side. Ensure to add `"use client"` at the top of any component file using this hook when using Next.js.

### Test it out!
After defining the action, ask the copilot to perform the task. For example, you can now ask the copilot to "select an employee" by specifying the `employeeId`.
